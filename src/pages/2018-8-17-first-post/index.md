I'm probably overengineering this blog, but that's okay. This has been a fun
learning experience, I get to use a technology that I like to use (React) while
also learning some new ones (GraphQL). Right now I'm writing this post in
Markdown, and Gatsby is transforming it into HTML for me! Pretty cool :)
