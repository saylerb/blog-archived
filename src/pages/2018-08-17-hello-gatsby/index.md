I'm probably overengineering this blog, but that's okay. This has been a fun
learning experience, I get to use a technology that I like to use (React) while
also learning some new ones (GraphQL). Right now I'm writing this post in
Markdown, and Gatsby is transforming it into HTML for me.

The Gatbsy documentation is great, and it's easy to get started by walking
through their [tutorial](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) and using one of
the [starters](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/).
